  abstract               = {Protein is the material foundation of living things, and it directly takes part in and runs the process of living things itself. Predicting protein complexes helps us understand the structure and function of complexes, and it is an important foundation for studying how cells work. Genome-wide protein interaction (PPI) data is growing as high-throughput experiments become more common. The aim of this research is that it provides a dual-tree complex wavelet transform which is used to find out about the structure of proteins. It also identifies the secondary structure of protein network. Many computer-based methods for predicting protein complexes have also been developed in the field. Identifying the secondary structure of a protein is very important when you are studying protein characteristics and properties. This is how the protein sequence is added to the distance matrix. The scope of this research is that it can confidently predict certain protein complexes rapidly, which compensates for shortcomings in biological research. The three-dimensional coordinates of C atom are used to do this. According to the texture information in the distance matrix, the matrix is broken down into four levels by the double-tree complex wavelet transform because it has four levels. The subband energy and standard deviation in different directions are taken, and then, the two-dimensional feature vector is used to show the secondary structure features of the protein in a way that is easy to understand. Then, the KNN and SVM classifiers are used to classify the features that were found. Experiments show that a new feature called a dual-tree complex wavelet can improve the texture granularity and directionality of the traditional feature extraction method, which is called secondary structure.},

  abstract = {Plants, unlike animals, exhibit a very high degree of plasticity in their growth and development and employ diverse strategies to cope with the variations during diurnal cycles and stressful conditions. Plants and animals, despite their remarkable morphological and physiological differences, share many basic cellular processes and regulatory mechanisms. Alternative splicing (AS) is one such gene regulatory mechanism that modulates gene expression in multiple ways. It is now well established that AS is prevalent in all multicellular eukaryotes including plants and humans. Emerging evidence indicates that in plants, as in animals, transcription and splicing are coupled. Here, we reviewed recent evidence in support of co-transcriptional splicing in plants and highlighted similarities and differences between plants and humans. An unsettled question in the field of AS is the extent to which splice isoforms contribute to protein diversity. To take a critical look at this question, we presented a comprehensive summary of the current status of research in this area in both plants and humans, discussed limitations with the currently used approaches and suggested improvements to current methods and alternative approaches. We end with a discussion on the potential role of epigenetic modifications and chromatin state in splicing memory in plants primed with stresses.},

In plants, the stability of many transcriptional regulators is mediated by the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome. Recent reports suggest that additional post-translational modifications modulate the ubiquitination and thus stability of transcriptional regulators. In addition to well-recognized phosphorylative control, particularly conjugation to the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO as well as thiol modification by nitric oxide to yield S-nitrosothiols, are emerging as key regulatory steps for governing protein ubiquitination in the nucleus. Complex interplay between these different post-translational modifications may provide robust control mechanisms to fine tune developmental and stress-responsive transcriptional programs.},

  abstract               = {The eggplant (Solanum melongena) is a popular vegetable around the world. However, the origin and evolution of eggplant has long been considered complex and unclear, which has become the barrier to improvements in eggplant breeding. Sequencing and comparative analyses of 13 complete chloroplast (cp) genomes of seven Solanum species were performed. Genome sizes were between 154,942 and 156,004 bp, the smallest genome was from S. torvum and the largest from S. macrocapon. Thirteen cp genomes showed highly conserved sequences and GC contents, particularly at the subgenus level. All genes in the 13 genomes were annotated. The cp genomes in this study comprised 130 genes (i.e., 80 protein-coding genes, 8 rRNA genes, and 42 tRNA genes), apart from S. sisymbriifolium, which had 129 (79 protein-coding genes, 8 rRNA genes, and 42 tRNA genes.). The rps16 was absent from the cp genome of S. sisymbriifolium, resulting in a nonsense mutation. Twelve hotspot regions of the cp genome were identified, which showed a series of sequence variations and differed significantly in the inverted repeat/single-copy boundary regions. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 46 cp genomic sequences to determine interspecific genetic and phylogenetic relationships in Solanum species. All species formed two branches, one of which contained all cultivars of the subgenus Leptostemonum. The cp genome data and phylogenetic analysis provides molecular evidence revealing the origin and evolutionary relationships of S. melongena and its wild relatives. Our findings suggest precise intra- and interspecies relatedness within the subgenus Leptostemonum, which has positive implications for work on improvements in eggplant breeding, particularly in producing heterosis, expanding the source of species variation, and breeding new varieties.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Among six extant tiger subspecies, the South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) once was widely distributed but is now the rarest one and extinct in the wild. All living South China tigers are descendants of only two male and four female wild-caught tigers and they survive solely in zoos after 60 years of effective conservation efforts. Inbreeding depression and hybridization with other tiger subspecies were believed to have occurred within the small, captive South China tiger population. It is therefore urgently needed to examine the genomic landscape of existing genetic variation among the South China tigers. RESULTS: In this study, we assembled a high-quality chromosome-level genome using long-read sequences and re-sequenced 29 high-depth genomes of the South China tigers. By combining and comparing our data with the other 40 genomes of six tiger subspecies, we identified two significantly differentiated genomic lineages among the South China tigers, which harbored some rare genetic variants introgressed from other tiger subspecies and thus maintained a moderate genetic diversity. We noticed that the South China tiger had higher F(ROH) values for longer runs of homozygosity (ROH > 1 Mb), an indication of recent inbreeding/founder events. We also observed that the South China tiger had the least frequent homozygous genotypes of both high- and moderate-impact deleterious mutations, and lower mutation loads than both Amur and Sumatran tigers. Altogether, our analyses indicated an effective genetic purging of deleterious mutations in homozygous states from the South China tiger, following its population contraction with a controlled increase in inbreeding based on its pedigree records. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of two unique founder/genomic lineages coupled with active genetic purging of deleterious mutations in homozygous states and the genomic resources generated in our study pave the way for a genomics-informed conservation, following the real-time monitoring and rational exchange of reproductive South China tigers among zoos.},

  abstract = {A diploid genome in the Saccharum complex facilitates our understanding of evolution in the highly polyploid Saccharum genus. Here we have generated a complete, gap-free genome assembly of Erianthus rufipilus, a diploid species within the Saccharum complex. The complete assembly revealed that centromere satellite homogenization was accompanied by the insertions of Gypsy retrotransposons, which drove centromere diversification. An overall low rate of gene transcription was observed in the palaeo-duplicated chromosome EruChr05 similar to other grasses, which might be regulated by methylation patterns mediated by homologous 24 nt small RNAs, and potentially mediating the functions of many nucleotide-binding site genes. Sequencing data for 211 accessions in the Saccharum complex indicated that Saccharum probably originated in the trans-Himalayan region from a diploid ancestor (x = 10) around 1.9-2.5 million years ago. Our study provides new insights into the origin and evolution of Saccharum and accelerates translational research in cereal genetics and genomics.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: The availability of multiple, essentially complete genome sequences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes spurred both the demand and the opportunity for the construction of an evolutionary classification of genes from these genomes. Such a classification system based on orthologous relationships between genes appears to be a natural framework for comparative genomics and should facilitate both functional annotation of genomes and large-scale evolutionary studies. RESULTS: We describe here a major update of the previously developed system for delineation of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) from the sequenced genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes and the construction of clusters of predicted orthologs for 7 eukaryotic genomes, which we named KOGs after eukaryotic orthologous groups. The COG collection currently consists of 138,458 proteins, which form 4873 COGs and comprise 75% of the 185,505 (predicted) proteins encoded in 66 genomes of unicellular organisms. The eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) include proteins from 7 eukaryotic genomes: three animals (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens), one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and the intracellular microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The current KOG set consists of 4852 clusters of orthologs, which include 59,838 proteins, or approximately 54% of the analyzed eukaryotic 110,655 gene products. Compared to the coverage of the prokaryotic genomes with COGs, a considerably smaller fraction of eukaryotic genes could be included into the KOGs; addition of new eukaryotic genomes is expected to result in substantial increase in the coverage of eukaryotic genomes with KOGs. Examination of the phyletic patterns of KOGs reveals a conserved core represented in all analyzed species and consisting of approximately 20% of the KOG set. This conserved portion of the KOG set is much greater than the ubiquitous portion of the COG set (approximately 1% of the COGs). In part, this difference is probably due to the small number of included eukaryotic genomes, but it could also reflect the relative compactness of eukaryotes as a clade and the greater evolutionary stability of eukaryotic genomes. CONCLUSION: The updated collection of orthologous protein sets for prokaryotes and eukaryotes is expected to be a useful platform for functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes, including those of complex eukaryotes, and genome-wide evolutionary studies.},

Orthologs typically have the same function, allowing transfer of functional information from one member to an entire COG.

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

GO annotations cover genes from organisms across the tree of life as well as viruses, though most gene function knowledge currently derives from experiments carried out in a relatively small number of model organisms. Here, we provide an updated overview of the GO knowledgebase, as well as the efforts of the broad, international consortium of scientists that develops, maintains, and updates the GO knowledgebase. The GO knowledgebase consists of three components: (1) the GO—a computational knowledge structure describing the functional characteristics of genes; (2) GO annotations—evidence-supported statements asserting that a specific gene product has a particular functional characteristic; and (3) GO Causal Activity Models (GO-CAMs)—mechanistic models of molecular “pathways” (GO biological processes) created by linking multiple GO annotations using defined relations. Each of these components is continually expanded, revised, and updated in response to newly published discoveries and receives extensive QA checks, reviews, and user feedback. For each of these components, we provide a description of the current contents, recent developments to keep the knowledgebase up to date with new discoveries, and guidance on how users can best make use of the data that we provide. We conclude with future directions for the project.}},

Node metadata display options have been extended and now also support non-numerical categorical values, as well as multiple values per node. Direct manual annotation is now available, providing a set of basic drawing and labeling tools, allowing users to draw shapes, labels and other features by hand directly onto the trees. Support for tree and dataset scales has been extended, providing fine control over line and label styles. Unrooted tree displays can now use the equal-daylight algorithm, proving a much greater display clarity.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Dunaliella salina dried biomass on the growth and adherence of 10 strains of Lactobacillus, Lacticaseibacillus, and Bifidobacterium. The immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and cytotoxic effects of D. salina on human peripheral mononuclear cells and simulated intestinal epithelial cell lines Caco-2 and HT-29 were evaluated. Furthermore, the hypocholesterolemic effects of the microalgae on lipid metabolism in rats fed a high-fat diet were analyzed. The addition of D. salina biomass had a positive effect on the growth of nine out of 10 probiotics and promoted the adherence of three bifidobacteria strains to human cell lines. The antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties of D. salina were concentration-dependent. The inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) were significantly increased following Dunaliella stimulation at the lowest concentration (0.5% w/v). Eight week supplementation of D. salina to the diet of hypercholesteromic rats significantly decreased the serum concentrations of LDL-C, VLDL, IDL-B, and IDL-C. D. salina is not cytotoxic in intestinal cell models; it promotes adherence of selected bifidobacteria, it affords immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects, and its addition to diets may help decrease atherosclerosis risk factors.},

  abstract               = {Carrots are a multi-nutritional food source. They are an important root vegetable, rich in natural bioactive compounds, which are recognised for their nutraceutical effects and health benefits. This review summarises the occurrence, biosynthesis, factors affecting concentration, and health benefits of phytochemicals found in Daucus carota. Two hundred and fifty-five articles including original research papers, books, and book chapters were analysed, of which one hundred and thirty articles (most relevant to the topic) were selected for writing the review article. The four types of phytochemicals found in carrots, namely phenolics, carotenoids, polyacetylenes, and ascorbic acid, were summarised. These chemicals aid in the risk reduction of cancer and cardiovascular diseases due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, plasma lipid modification, and anti-tumour properties. Numerous factors influence the amount and type of phytochemicals present in carrots. Genotype (colour differences) plays an important role; high contents of α and β-carotene are present in orange carrots, lutein in yellow carrots, lycopene in red carrots, anthocyanins in the root of purple carrots, and phenolic compounds abound in black carrots. Carotenoids range between 3.2 mg/kg and 170 mg/kg, while vitamin C varies from 21 mg/kg to 775 mg/kg between cultivars. Growth temperatures of carrots influence the level of the sugars, carotenoids, and volatile compounds, so that growing in cool conditions results in a higher yield and quality of carrots, while higher temperatures would increase terpene synthesis, resulting in carrots with a bitter taste. It is worthwhile to investigate the cultivation of different genotypes under various environmental conditions to increase levels of phytochemicals and enhance the nutritional value of carrot, along with the valorisation of carrot by-products.},

  abstract               = {Although the evolutionary significance of the early-diverging flowering plant Amborella (Amborella trichopoda Baill.) is widely recognized, its metabolic landscape, particularly specialized metabolites, is currently underexplored. In this work, we analyzed the metabolomes of Amborella tissues using liquid chromatography high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-HR-ESI-MS). By matching the mass spectra of Amborella metabolites with those of authentic phytochemical standards in the publicly accessible libraries, 63, 39, and 21 compounds were tentatively identified in leaves, stems, and roots, respectively. Free amino acids, organic acids, simple sugars, cofactors, as well as abundant glycosylated and/or methylated phenolic specialized metabolites were observed in Amborella leaves. Diverse metabolites were also detected in stems and roots, including those that were not identified in leaves. To understand the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites with glycosyl and methyl modifications, families of small molecule UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) and O-methyltransferases (OMTs) were identified in the Amborella genome and the InterPro database based on conserved functional domains. Of the 17 phylogenetic groups of plant UGTs (A-Q) defined to date, Amborella UGTs are absent from groups B, N, and P, but they are highly abundant in group L. Among the 25 Amborella OMTs, 7 cluster with caffeoyl-coenzyme A (CCoA) OMTs involved in lignin and phenolic metabolism, whereas 18 form a clade with plant OMTs that methylate hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, or alkaloids. Overall, this first report of metabolomes and candidate metabolic genes in Amborella provides a starting point to a better understanding of specialized metabolites and biosynthetic enzymes in this basal lineage of flowering plants.},

  abstract           = {In the context of a recent massive increase in research on plant root functions and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many important challenges to keep on generating cutting-edge, meaningful and integrated knowledge. Consideration of the below-ground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons across studies and integration of information across databases by providing standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below-ground ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below-ground plant entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine-root vs coarse-root approach; (2) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical, but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections I-VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.},

Understanding how different amino acid metabolisms are connected with other biological pathways is therefore important. In addition to protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism is also tightly linked to energy and carbohydrate metabolism, the carbon-nitrogen budget, hormone and secondary metabolism, stress responses, and so on. Here, we update the currently available information on the connections between amino acid metabolisms, which tend to be overlooked in higher plants. Particular emphasis was placed on the connections between lysine metabolism and other pathways, such as tryptophan metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, abiotic and biotic stress responses, starch metabolism, and the unfolded protein response. Interestingly, regulation of lysine metabolism was found to differ between plant species, as is the case between dicots and monocots. Determining the metabolic connection between amino acid metabolisms will help improve our understanding of the metabolic flux, supporting studies on crop nutrition.},

  abstract           = {Loss of plant diversity with increased anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition in grasslands has occurred globally. In most cases, competitive exclusion driven by preemption of light or space is invoked as a key mechanism. Here, we provide evidence from a 9-yr N-addition experiment for an alternative mechanism: differential sensitivity of forbs and grasses to increased soil manganese (Mn) levels. In Inner Mongolia steppes, increasing the N supply shifted plant community composition from grass-forb codominance (primarily Stipa krylovii and Artemisia frigida, respectively) to exclusive dominance by grass, with associated declines in overall species richness. Reduced abundance of forbs was linked to soil acidification that increased mobilization of soil Mn, with a 10-fold greater accumulation of Mn in forbs than in grasses. The enhanced accumulation of Mn in forbs was correlated with reduced photosynthetic rates and growth, and is consistent with the loss of forb species. Differential accumulation of Mn between forbs and grasses can be linked to fundamental differences between dicots and monocots in the biochemical pathways regulating metal transport. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for N-induced species loss in temperate grasslands by linking metal mobilization in soil to differential metal acquisition and impacts on key functional groups in these ecosystems.},
