This study comprehensively explores plant protein sequences and 
their adaptive relationships based on KOGs, utilizing data 
collection and analysis methods that integrate bioinformatics 
tools, hierarchical classification, and statistical analyses.


\subsection{Data Collection and Selection}
\label{sec:method.data}

A comprehensive dataset of protein sequences from diverse plants 
is sourced from the PhytozomeV13 Database~\citep{goodstein2011}.
This dataset consists of 114 proteomes, including 100 
Angiosperms (29 Monocots, 70 Eudicots, and \emph{Amborella 
trichopoda}), 10 Algae (9 \emph{Chlorophyta} and 1 
\emph{Rhodophyta}), and 4 other species: \emph{Marchantia 
polymorpha}, \emph{Physcomitrella patens}, \emph{Selaginella 
moellendorffii}, and \emph{Sphagnum fallax}. Careful selection 
ensures representation across various plant families and a 
broad taxonomic range.


\subsection{Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOGs) Analysis}
\label{sec:method.kog}

The Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOGs) database 
by \cite{tatusov2003} is used to analyze the collected protein 
sequences (available at
\url{https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/COG/KOG/}). 
The BLASTP sequence alignment algorithm maps the 
selected protein sequences to the corresponding KOGs, 
identifying orthologous groups and conserved 
domains~\citep{camacho2009}. Only BLASTP matches with an 
identity greater than or equal to 95\% and e-value lower 
than -10 are considered.
Subsequently, annotations are transferred to all species, 
and the frequency of each annotation is assessed as the 
number of proteins belonging to this annotation (e.g., K - 
Transcription). Protein counts are scaled relative to the 
total number of proteins in each organism, enabling a 
fair comparison despite varying annotation coverage after 
BLASTP alignment.


\subsection{Hierarchical Classification based on KOG Counts}
\label{sec:method.hierarchy}

To gain insights into the evolutionary relationships among 
the studied plant species, a hierarchical classification 
system is employed based on KOG counts of annotated proteins. 
The normalized frequency of each annotation serves as a 
26-dimensional vector representation for each species. Using the 
"ward" method for linkage and "euclidean" metric, a hierarchical 
organization of plant species with similar KOG profiles is 
obtained at different taxonomic levels. The linkage approach 
provides a visual representation 
of the relationships between taxa, offering a hierarchical 
perspective of plant evolution. Additional vignettes were 
included in the graphical representation to apply biological 
categories to plants: Monocot, Eudicot, Alga, or Other. 
For simplicity, \emph{Amborella trichopoda} is included in 
the \emph{Other} category for simplicity.


\subsection{Comparison of Gene Ontology and Phytozome}
\label{sec:method.compare}

To validate the KOG-based classification of Phytozome proteomes 
and explore the functional implications of identified 
orthologous groups, a 
comparison with information from the Gene Ontology (GO) 
database is performed~\citep{ashburner2000,consortium2023}.
Namely, the annotated proteomes of GO are retrieved, and the 
same procedure of KOG annotation transfer is performed on them.

The results obtained with Phytozome are summarized by 
computing the mean and standard deviation for each KOG 
category among all species and each phylogenetic category. 
Similarly, functional annotations from the GO database are 
transferred to each organism using BLASTP, and frequency 
counts for those annotations are computed. Besides, an 
additional computation is performed on the frequency counts, 
referred to as normalized count: the frequencies 
for a proteome were scaled to add up to 1. Note that these 
values are different from the results of the previous 
scaling procedure, due to the vast amount of proteins 
without a representative ortholog in the model proteome 
of KOG. Furthermore, the normalized values for each 
biological category are computed for the Phytozome data and
compared among them and against the global distribution.

Through statistical analyses and correlation studies, the 
concordance between the KOG-based classification of Phytozome 
and GO is assessed. This comparison allows for the 
evaluation of consistency and reliability of the 
hierarchical classification and provides insights into the 
functional importance of the identified protein groups.
